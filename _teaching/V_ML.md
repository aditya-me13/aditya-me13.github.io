### Jan '23 - Apr '24, IIT Gandhinagar

* Designed and implemented a **real-time face recognition** system using eigenfaces, exploring the nuances of facial recognition algorithms, and evaluated their efficacy on diverse datasets from the Sklearn library of python.
* Worked on **dimentionality reduction** and **objects classification** with various Machine Learning Models of Sklearn.
* Crafted a comprehensive Data Narrative, exploring scientific questions on given dataset and their hypotheses along with their scientific answers using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib and more.
