### Key Features 
* Implemented advanced numerical analysis techniques to precisely determine the mass of propellant consumed for **ISRO's Mangalyaan Mission** during the satellite's initial five maneuvers around the Earth's orbit.
* Implemented numerical techniques, including Eulerâ€™s method and Runge-Kutta method, to discretize energy and iteratively determine the mass of propellants. Also studied about Oberth's Maneuver effect for orbital transition.
