* Utilized the UCI-HAR dataset, which comprises time-series data capturing the activities of thirty subjects engaging in six different activities classified as walking, sitting, standing, running up, running straight and running down.
* Employed the TSFEL library for feature extraction from the time-series data, followed by **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality. Developed and trained a Decision Tree model using the extracted features.
* Utilized the Physics Toolbox Suite app to collect activity data for testing the trained model's performance.
