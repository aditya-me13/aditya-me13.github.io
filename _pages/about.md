About Me:
-----
Hello! My name is Aditya Mehta and I am trying to make "Hello World" my new "ABC".

- I am currently a junior Undergraduate at one of the most prestigious technological institutes, **Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar**, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
-	I am currently mastering my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms for Software Development and Machine Learning to solve real-life problems. I like CODING.
- I am fascinated by the intersection of Technology and Finance, and currently exploring trading technologies and understanding markets.
- I am also exploring fields of Data Science, Digital Signal Processing and Hardware Implementation within Computer Architecture.
-	Fun fact: I love delving into various domains of Computer Science, but I am too lazy to find a balance between them.

My Background:
-------

- Born and raised in **Mandvi**, Gujarat, I spent the first 15 years of my life there with my parents, younger sister, grandmother, and late grandfather. I am a **Jain** by religion, **Gujju** by blood, and **Indian** by heart.
-  With good results in 10th grade, like any typical brown family kid, I was encouraged to pursue “**ENGINEERING**”. At 16, after completing 10th grade, I moved to **Adipur**, Gujarat for my Intermediate Educaton while preparing for the JEE Mains exam. A special thanks to Neeraj Rajvanshi Sir **(R.I.S.E.)** for laying a strong foundation of my interests in Logical Thinking.
- The COVID-19 pandemic led to early completion of GSEB 12th board exams and a delay in JEE Mains and Advanced. I made the most of this time by heading to the most “famous” place for IIT-JEE preparation—**KOTA**. This was a 4-month crash course at “**ATP-Star**”. Luckily, it was the right decision, and I got selected for IIT.
- I’ve always been blessed with luck and unwavering support. Many people have invested in my journey, particularly my **Parents**. I will consider myself successful if I can return even 10% of what they have invested in me.

Hobbies and Interests:
------

- Apart from passion for engineering, I like music, food, **garba** and travelling. But my absolute favorite pastime? Without a doubt, it's hibernating. They say you need more sleep to complete your Big Dreams.
- When it comes to entertainment, I'm an huge fan of the "**Wizarding-World**", "**Marvel-Cinematic-Universe**" and "**FRIENDS**". They never fail to ignite my imagination and keep me thoroughly entertained.
- Bollywood movies and songs are inseperable part of my life. If you're someone who gets jumps aloud when I shout "Pani," then we're definitely on the same wavelength!
- A figure who has truly inspired me is **Mr. Dilip Joshi**, fondly known as **Jethalal**. His portrayal always manages to bring a smile to my face, even during the toughest of times. Hopefully I will get the previlage to shake hands with him some day. No Doubt, I like "Tarak Mehta ka Oolta Chashma" more than anything else.
- I find immense joy in activities like **Video Editing** and **Graphic Designing**—they're more than just hobbies to me; they're a form of artistic expression.
- While I prefer to keep my life organized and clean, there's something comforting about the chaos of a messy cupboard and messy hair. I confess, I have quite the sweet tooth—I simply can't resist ice-creams!!
- Like most Indians, cricket holds a special place in my heart, but I also enjoy lawn tennis and badminton for some recreational fun.
- I have a deep appreciation for the beauty of Hindi and Urdu poetry, the soulful lyrics of Gujarati folk music, and the wisdom found in English quotes and phrases.
