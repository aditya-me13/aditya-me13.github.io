<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

About Me:

- ðŸ”­ I am currently strengthening my grip at Machine Learning solutions to real life problems, along side exploring Software Developement and Hardware Implementation on Computer Architecture. In a nutshell EXPLORING.
- ðŸŒ± My deep interest also lies in Data Science and Digital Signal Processing Domains of Computer Science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like exploring as many domains of Computer Science as possible; but I am too lazy to find a balance between them. ðŸ˜„
