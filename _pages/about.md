<h2>My Background:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Born and raised in <strong>Mandvi</strong>, Gujarat, I spent the first 15 years of my life there with my parents, younger sister, grandmother, and late grandfather. I am a <strong>Jain</strong> by religion, <strong>Gujju</strong> by blood, and <strong>Indian</strong> by heart.</li>
  <li>With good results in 10th grade, like any typical brown family kid, I was encouraged to pursue “<strong>ENGINEERING</strong>”. At 16, after completing 10th grade, I moved to <strong>Adipur</strong>, Gujarat for my Intermediate Educaton while preparing for the JEE Mains exam. A special thanks to Neeraj Rajvanshi Sir <strong>(R.I.S.E.)</strong> for laying a strong foundation of my interests in Logical Thinking.</li>
  <li>The COVID-19 pandemic led to early completion of GSEB 12th board exams and a delay in JEE Mains and Advanced. I made the most of this time by heading to the most “famous” place for IIT-JEE preparation—<strong>KOTA</strong>. This was a 4-month crash course at “<strong>ATP-Star</strong>”. Luckily, it was the right decision, and I got selected for IIT.</li>
  <li>I’ve always been blessed with luck and unwavering support. Many people have invested in my journey, particularly my <strong>Parents</strong>. I will consider myself successful if I can return even 10% of what they have invested in me.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Hobbies and Interests:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Apart from passion for engineering, I like music, food, <strong>garba</strong> and travelling. But my absolute favorite pastime? Without a doubt, it's hibernating. They say you need more sleep to complete your Big Dreams.</li>
  <li>When it comes to entertainment, I'm an huge fan of the "<strong>Wizarding-World</strong>", "<strong>Marvel-Cinematic-Universe</strong>" and "<strong>FRIENDS</strong>". They never fail to ignite my imagination and keep me thoroughly entertained.</li>
  <li>Bollywood movies and songs are inseperable part of my life. If you're someone who gets jumps aloud when I shout "Pani," then we're definitely on the same wavelength!</li>
  <li>A figure who has truly inspired me is <strong>Mr. Dilip Joshi</strong>, fondly known as <strong>Jethalal</strong>. His portrayal always manages to bring a smile to my face, even during the toughest of times. Hopefully I will get the previlage to shake hands with him some day. No Doubt, I like "Tarak Mehta ka Oolta Chashma" more than anything else.</li>
  <li>I find immense joy in activities like <strong>Video Editing</strong> and <strong>Graphic Designing</strong>—they're more than just hobbies to me; they're a form of artistic expression.</li>
  <li>While I prefer to keep my life organized and clean, there's something comforting about the chaos of a messy cupboard and messy hair. I confess, I have quite the sweet tooth—I simply can't resist ice-creams!!</li>
  <li>Like most Indians, cricket holds a special place in my heart, but I also enjoy lawn tennis and badminton for some recreational fun.</li>
  <li>I have a deep appreciation for the beauty of Hindi and Urdu poetry, the soulful lyrics of Gujarati folk music, and the wisdom found in English quotes and phrases.</li>
</ul>
