[Kapidhwaj AI](https://www.kapidhwaj.ai/) | Machine Learning and AI Developer Intern
=====
Industrial Intern | Research Park, Gandhinagar | _May '24 - July -24_

### Goals:
- Build a scalable face recognition pipeline using python libraries, ensuring high accuracy and low latency. [Demo](https://github.com/aditya-me13/Face_Recognition)
- Configured **Yolov8n** and **Arcface** models to achieve high accuracy, alongside integrating the **ChromaDB** vector
database to store and retrieve embeddings more efficiently, significantly enhancing overall processing speed.
- Containerized the entire project into a **Docker Image** and used this to build containers on **Google Virtual Machines**.
- Developed the **Middleware API** with multiple endpoints using FastAPI module, streamlining management
of various model instances via API requests. Utilized **SQLAlchemy** for efficient GCP database management.
